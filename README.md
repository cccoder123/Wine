# Wine
Run
git clone https://github.com/cccoder123/Wine
cd Wine
chmod -x install-1.sh
./install-1.sh

Add the following lines in the nano text editor which will open:
deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/debian/ buster main
deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/Debian_10 ./

Then run:
chmod -x install-2.sh
./install-2.sh



I DID NOT MAKE THIS. To visit the official website, go to https://winehq.org
